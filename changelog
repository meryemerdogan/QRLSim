# Changelog

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Packaged module structure under `qrlsim/` (including `qrlsim/core/`).
- `QRLSimulator.step_one_event()` to advance the simulation by a single arrival/service event.
- Gymnasium environment: `qrlsim/aqm_envs/MM1_env.py` (M/M/1 with keep/drop action).
- Training scripts: `train/train_dqn.py` (DQN) and `train/train_ppo.py` (PPO) using Stable-Baselines3.
- Smoke test script: `qrlsim/core/test.py`.
- Dockerfile placeholder.

### Changed
- Updated simulator imports to package paths (`from qrlsim.core...`).
- Refactored terminal simulation loop to call `step_one_event()` each iteration.
- `_serve()` now only serves when the queue is non-empty and at least one idle server exists.
- FIFO/LIFO/SIRO serving now explicitly selects an idle server (instead of `argmin` over finish times).

### Fixed
- Fixed service duration indexing when scheduling service completion (use pre-increment index, then increment counter).
- Prevented serving attempts when no idle servers are available (early return).

### Removed
- Removed root-level `QRLSimulator.py`, `QueueModel.py`, and `test.py` (moved into the `qrlsim/` package structure).
